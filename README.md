# Data Camp - Project 1

## Project Plan

### Objective
The project will gather stock data from a public API and make it available for consumption by Analysts.

### Consumers & Questions
The output dataset is thoroughly documented and can be easily accessed by authorized Data / Business Analysts either to do ad-hoc queries or connecting the corporate BI tool to provide meaningful insights to Investors. 
For this particular development, we aim to provide a dataset capable of tackling the following questions:
 - Which are the tickers that had the highest growth since Covid
 - What is the average growth for all the tickers during the same time frame
 - For the top tickers, what was their growth over the last 6 months and 1 year
This will help investors having an idea of the best commodities to invest in.

### Data Sources
Market indicators using the REST API suggested in the project definition will be used: **Marketstack API**.
